# ÄÄNIAALTO III is here!

ÄÄNIAALTO is Aalto Media Lab’s annual audiovisual festival in Helsinki showcasing works, installations and performances. In this third edition we aim to gather striking oddities of sound and new media art in forms of performances, workshops, installations, fixed media works and talks. Some of the topics that gravitate around this edition are: robotic instruments, AI vs human control, intersection between biology and sound, and custom instruments for AV performance, but we challenge the potential participants to present us more intriguing ways of producing, using and manipulating sound. 

ÄÄNIAALTO III will take place from the 5th to 10th of March at Kallio Stage, Vapaan Taiteen Tila and Kuusi Palaa. All the events are free of charge!
