# Join DADA

DADA is a student association founded by students of the Media Lab Helsinki of Aalto University. We are founded to support and organise events related to the interests of Media Lab students in a broad sense, to support the membersâ€™ professional development and networking both during and after their studies. The association also aims to promote the fields of study in the Media Lab within the Aalto University and broader society. 

Anybody is welcomed to become a member of the association, but keep in mind only degree students at Aalto University (members of AYY) can vote or apply to the board.
