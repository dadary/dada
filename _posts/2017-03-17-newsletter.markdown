We hope you are enjoying the many events DADA has been hosting over the past year. We are very grateful for your support and participation. You help keep the DADAness alive!

The Spring meeting is upon us and we will be discussing our plans for the rest of the year and there will be voting today as part of some legislation changes that we are proposing. We do hope to see you there, DADA is nothing without it’s members.

The DADA membership fee is a meagre 11 euros. It is required for each member to pay this fee to be able to take part in proceedings such as the voting for legislation changes and other activities that are planned under the DADA banner.

If you haven’t done so already, please reach out to Andreas Sode — DADA Treasurer and Board Member, during today’s meeting (or if you are unable to make it today, then any other time you find him).

Looking forward to seeing you all today at Vapaan Taiteen Tila, 1630 onwards!

Warm regards,
The DADA Board

PS: The Spring Meeting will be followed by the amazing [Autotel’s album launch](https://www.facebook.com/events/256679538122877/) so don’t forget your dancing shoes and your drinks (of course)
