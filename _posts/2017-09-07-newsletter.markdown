# Want to join the board?
Our board consists of 13 positions which are divided into: president, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, 5 board members and 2 vice-members.

Our official fall meeting will be on Friday 03. November all board members change every year.

So if you have one or more years of studies left consider joining the association. For more info ask any board member or use your preferred channel of communication!

# Let's talk about Christmas
This year's Christmas party will take place on Thursday 13, December in Rantasauna, Otaniemi.

The party will be organized by our new students, so we are all very excited about what they will come up with!

If you hear about other Christmas parties in the department please tell them that they are welcome to join ours to make it a department wide party!
