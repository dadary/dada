# DADA Night
As discussed at the last DADA night, we want DADA nights to foster a more collaborative culture while sharing each other’s achievements, goals, projects and needs. So at this DADA night, the floor is yours, to showcase a new project, talk about a new idea, reach out for collaborators, get feedback on your prototype, test your game! It’s nothing formal, so no presentations needed, nor does everything have to be prepared. Keep it short and sweet and looking forward to seeing what DADA members are up to!

DADA Night takes place on 24th February at MST3 1830 onwards

# Upcoming Company Visits
DADA goes to Futurice on Tuesday, 21.2! There are still spots available to join us as we meet Futurice, learn about their approach, and build connections with the company. Join the event and register via [Eventbrite](https://www.facebook.com/events/617177895146108/)

In March, we’ll visit Frantic and get to know how they make things happen. Date TBD, and we’ll share information here and on Facebook when we have it.

# Board Game Night: Pandemic!
Our next Board Game Night is going to take place on Thursday, 2nd of March, at 17:00. The featured game of the night will be Pandemic. Joins us to the 5th floor Games Classroom, and don’t forget to bring snacks and your decontamination kit!

# Miestentie 3 reshuffle: Latest Update
The spaces should get their final reshuffling soon. Management has now approved proposals made by DADA. There’ll be some new working areas, 4th floor VR set will have a room of it’s own and we’ll get more and better group working places. There’ll be even some new coffee cups in the fifth floor kitchen!

# DASH’ 17 organizing committee meeting
Building on last year's success we would like to make DASH happen again!
The festival should be defined and rehalised by the wider Media Lab community. Therefore we invite everyone interested in participating and organising the 2017 edition of DASH to attend this first meeting, during which we would like to define the scale and goal of this year's festival.
