# Upcoming Company Visits
Please join us for another company visit, this time to design/strategy/engineering wunderkind Reaktor! We'll have a chance to meet with two of Reaktor's designers and learn more about how Reaktor approaches their work and how they organize the design side of their business.

If you can join us, make sure you register for a ticket ([Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dada-goes-to-reaktor-tickets-34141259426)) if you intend to come! Tickets are limited, and limited to DADA members only, so please grab one if you're sure you can make it.

# New Media Program development meeting
This is an invitation to meet on Monday 22.5.2017 at 9:00 - 12:00 in classroom 426 to discuss how to develop and improve the New Media Design & Production major.

If you can’t make it, or want to prepare beforehand, please give us your comments on this questionnaire online. What we are asking is:

KEEP: what is great and absolutely needs to protected in the future
UPDATE: what is important, but needs to be renewed for the future (and why)
DELETE: what doesn't work and is not needed
ADD: what is missing and should be added to the major

The form should allow anonymous commenting, and since all are open comments you can return and add more comments if you feel you forgot to express something important.

Also, don’t forget to give individual course feedback too - every response *IS* read and considered.
