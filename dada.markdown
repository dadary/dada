#About

Aalto Media Lab Student Association DADA Ry is a new student association founded by students of the Media Lab Helsinki of Aalto University.

DADA was founded to support and organise events related to the interests of Media Lab students in a broad sense, to support the members’ professional development and networking during and after studies. The association also aims to promote the fields of study in the Media Lab within the Aalto University and broader society.

#Activites

At our home building at Miestentie 3 we host monthly DADA Night get-togethers, regular Games clubs, we run a SnackBar and take part in improving the general comfort and amenities of our premises. DADA collaborates with companies related to design and media industry and we conduct regular company visits. DADA keeps an eye on our newcomers too, and organises tutoring in collaboration with the department.

#Events

DADA produces yearly two larger events: Ääniaalto Sound Festival during winter and DASH New Media Festival at the end of May. Throughout the year we host Cryptoparties, Alumni afterworks, Sitsit in our own style, we celebrate Vappu together and as a culmination of the year we organise the legendary Media Lab Xmas party.
